COVID-19 outbreak analysis in Germany with R
--------------------------------------------

The conducted analysis follows the posts by Tim Churches, starting with
his post February 2020:

The code is slightly changed, some graphs are tweaked. All in all this
is supposed to help scientists as well as non-scientists to gain
insights and conduct their own analysis of the situation.
